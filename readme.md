Mastermind
==========

In this project, a scalable guessing algorithm using local search is implemented for the classical game of **Mastermind** (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)).

For benchmarking purposes, 2 other guessing algorithms (exhaustive search and greedy heuristic search) are also implemented so that the running time among these algorithms can be compared.

The program also implements a manual guessing mode, user of the program can try to guess the secret number on his/her own.

The program implements a simple command line interface. The UI is pretty self-explanatory. To run the program:

	javac src/Mastermind.java
	java bin/Mastermind
